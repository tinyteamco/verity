## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Passed

**Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs and business value. No technical implementation details (frameworks, databases, etc.). Written in plain language suitable for stakeholders.

**Requirements**: 51 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-051), all testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made using industry standards, existing backend implementation, pipecat-momtest codebase analysis, and recruitment platform integration patterns.

Requirement categories:
- Link Generation & Management: FR-001 to FR-005 (5 requirements)
- Participant Access: FR-006 to FR-009 (4 requirements)
- Interview Completion (Callback): FR-010 to FR-014 (5 requirements)
- Artifact Management: FR-015 to FR-018 (4 requirements)
- Interview Tracking: FR-019 to FR-023 (5 requirements)
- Optional Participant Sign-In: FR-024 to FR-026 (3 requirements)
- Security & Privacy: FR-027 to FR-029 (3 requirements)
- Pipecat Integration: FR-030 to FR-036 (7 requirements)
- Recruitment Platform (Reusable Links): FR-037 to FR-041 (5 requirements)
- Participant Identity & Sign-In: FR-042 to FR-051 (10 requirements)

**Success Criteria**: 10 measurable criteria, all technology-agnostic:
- Time-based (10 seconds, 5 seconds, 3 clicks, under 2 seconds API, under 30 seconds claim)
- Performance-based (95% success rate, automatic completion)
- Outcome-based (completion rate improvement, on-the-fly creation, cross-platform dashboard)

**Acceptance Scenarios**: 9 user stories with complete Given/When/Then scenarios. Each story is independently testable and prioritized (P1-P3).
- US1-US4: Core interview flow (P1-P2)
- US5-US6: Recruitment platform integration (P2)
- US7-US9: Participant identity and profiles (P2-P3)

**Edge Cases**: 12 edge cases identified with clear handling strategies (includes recruitment platform scenarios, identity reconciliation, storage failures).

**Scope**: Clear boundaries between in-scope (MVP) and out-of-scope (future) features. Constraints explicitly documented. Webhooks deferred to post-MVP (YAGNI).

**Dependencies**: 4 dependencies identified (Study Management with slugs, Firebase Auth, Shared Object Storage, Pipecat-momtest). 6 reasonable assumptions documented (includes recruitment platform trust model, external ID uniqueness, pipecat callback reachability).

## Notes

**Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.**

No clarifications needed - all critical decisions were made based on:
- Existing backend implementation (share links, interviews, recordings endpoints already exist)
- Industry standard practices (100MB file size limit, common audio formats)
- Project architecture patterns (Firebase Auth, multi-tenancy)
- URL-passing integration pattern for loose coupling with separate interview component

**Integration Architecture Documented**:

**Pipecat-momtest Integration**:
- Interactive interview component is pipecat-momtest (https://github.com/tinyteamco/pipecat-momtest) - separate application, out of scope
- Uses "pull" pattern: pipecat fetches interview data from Verity, posts completion back
- Concrete API contracts defined for both directions (Verity ↔ Pipecat)
- Pipecat codebase analyzed to identify integration points:
  - Hardcoded scripts need to be replaced with dynamic guide injection
  - Completion handler needs webhook to POST back to Verity
  - Download endpoints already exist for artifacts
- Requires CORS support for cross-origin requests

**Recruitment Platform Integration** (NEW):
- **Reusable slug-based links**: `https://verity.com/study/{slug}/start?pid={{PARTICIPANT_ID}}`
  - Creates interviews on-the-fly when accessed
  - Simple integration, no API auth required
  - Works with Prolific, UserTesting, Respondent, UserInterviews, etc.
  - pid parameter is optional (supports both platform tracking and direct distribution)
- **Webhooks**: Deferred to post-MVP (YAGNI - most platforms track completion themselves)

**Participant Identity & Sign-In** (NEW):
- Optional pre-interview sign-in (interstitial page)
- Post-interview claim flow (thank-you page)
- Cross-platform identity reconciliation (verity_user_id + external_participant_id)
- Participant profile dashboard (view history across platforms)

**Required Changes**:
- **Verity Backend**:
  - Add `GET /interview/{token}` (public) - pipecat data fetch
  - Add `POST /interview/{token}/complete` (callback) - pipecat completion
  - Add `GET /study/{slug}/start?pid={external_id}` (public) - reusable links (creates interviews on-the-fly)
  - Add VerityUser account creation and management (Firebase)
  - Add participant profile dashboard and claim flow
  - Artifact proxy endpoints for researchers (stream from GCS)
  - CORS configuration for public endpoints

- **Verity Frontend**:
  - Link generation UI (manual, reusable template display)
  - Interview list/detail views (transcripts inline, audio download)
  - Interstitial page for pre-interview sign-in
  - Thank-you page with claim flow
  - Participant profile dashboard

- **Pipecat-momtest**:
  - Add dynamic guide endpoint (replace hardcoded prompts)
  - Add completion callback to POST back to Verity
  - Support Verity access tokens in WebSocket flow

The backend already has most required endpoints per the OpenAPI spec, so implementation will primarily focus on:
1. Frontend UI for all new flows (links, dashboards, sign-in)
2. Integration orchestration (redirects, callbacks)
3. Participant identity system (VerityUser, claim flow)
4. Recruitment platform reusable links (on-the-fly interview creation)
