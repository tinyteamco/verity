# Planning Artifacts Audit

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Auditor**: Claude Code
**Purpose**: Ensure planning artifacts provide clear implementation path with proper cross-references

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. Technical Context Has Stale "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" Markers

**File**: `plan.md` (lines 33-35)
**Issue**: Technical Context still shows "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" for resolved items:
- Pipecat Integration: NEEDS CLARIFICATION ❌
- Participant Identity Flows: NEEDS CLARIFICATION ❌
- Shared GCS Bucket IAM: NEEDS CLARIFICATION ❌

**Fix Required**: Update Technical Context to reference `research.md` where all clarifications were resolved.

---

### 2. Missing Implementation Roadmap in plan.md

**File**: `plan.md`
**Issue**: No clear implementation sequence in the plan itself. While `quickstart.md` has 6 phases, `plan.md` doesn't provide a high-level roadmap.

**Expected**: A section like:
```markdown
## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (~2 hours)
Reference: [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-1-infrastructure-pulumi)
- GCS bucket creation via Pulumi
- IAM role bindings

### Phase 2: Database Models (~3 hours)
Reference: [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-2-database-models)
- Study model modifications
- Interview, VerityUser, ParticipantProfile models
- Alembic migrations

### Phase 3: Backend API Endpoints (~8 hours)
Reference: [contracts/](./contracts/), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-3-backend-api-endpoints)
- Public interview access
- Pipecat integration
- Researcher endpoints

### Phase 4: Participant Identity (~4 hours)
Reference: [research.md](./research.md#2-participant-identity-flows), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-4-participant-identity-endpoints)
- Claim flow
- Participant dashboard

### Phase 5: Researcher UI (~4 hours)
Reference: [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-5-researcher-endpoints--artifact-proxy)
- Artifact proxy
- Interview list

### Phase 6: Frontend UI (~10 hours)
Reference: [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md#phase-6-frontend-ui-components)
- Study settings
- Interview list
- Participant flows
```

**Fix Required**: Add Implementation Roadmap section to plan.md

---

### 3. No Cross-References Between Artifacts

**Files**: All planning artifacts
**Issue**: Documents don't reference each other effectively. For example:

**In plan.md**:
- Technical Context mentions pipecat integration but doesn't link to research.md
- Project Structure shows files but doesn't link to data-model.md for schema details
- No mention of contracts/ for API specs

**In data-model.md**:
- Doesn't reference contracts/ for API endpoint details
- Doesn't mention quickstart.md for implementation steps

**In quickstart.md**:
- References documents at the end, but not inline where relevant

**Fix Required**: Add inline cross-references throughout documents

---

### 4. Missing Implementation Dependencies

**File**: `plan.md` or potentially a new section
**Issue**: No explicit dependency graph showing which tasks must be completed before others.

**Expected**: A dependencies section like:
```markdown
## Implementation Dependencies

```
graph TD
    A[Infra: GCS Bucket] --> B[Backend: Models]
    B --> C[Backend: Public Endpoints]
    B --> D[Backend: Researcher Endpoints]
    C --> E[Frontend: Study Settings]
    D --> F[Frontend: Interview List]
    C --> G[Pipecat Integration]
```

- Infrastructure must complete before backend development
- Models must exist before endpoints
- Public endpoints must exist before pipecat integration
- Backend endpoints must exist before frontend UI
```

**Fix Required**: Add dependency information to plan.md or quickstart.md

---

### 5. Unclear Entry Point for Developers

**File**: `plan.md`
**Issue**: No clear "Start here" guidance for developers beginning implementation.

**Expected**: Near the top of plan.md:
```markdown
## For Developers

**Starting implementation?** Follow this sequence:

1. **Read specifications**: [spec.md](./spec.md) - Understand requirements
2. **Review technical decisions**: [research.md](./research.md) - Key design choices
3. **Understand data model**: [data-model.md](./data-model.md) - Database schema
4. **Check API contracts**: [contracts/](./contracts/) - Endpoint specifications
5. **Follow implementation guide**: [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) - Step-by-step phases

**TL;DR**: Most developers should start with [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) Phase 1.
```

**Fix Required**: Add "For Developers" section to plan.md

---

### 6. quickstart.md Missing Reference Back to plan.md

**File**: `quickstart.md`
**Issue**: Quickstart references other docs at the end, but doesn't mention that plan.md has the big picture.

**Expected**: At the top:
```markdown
**Note**: This is the detailed implementation guide. For the big picture, see [plan.md](./plan.md).
```

**Fix Required**: Add note at top of quickstart.md

---

### 7. contracts/README.md Lacks Implementation Context

**File**: `contracts/README.md`
**Issue**: Excellent API documentation, but doesn't connect to the implementation workflow.

**Expected**: Add section:
```markdown
## Implementation Workflow

When implementing these endpoints:

1. **Write BDD tests first** - See [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md#testing-workflow) for BDD cycle
2. **Check data model** - See [data-model.md](../data-model.md) for schema details
3. **Follow security patterns** - See section "Authorization Patterns" above
4. **Reference implementation code** - See [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md) Phase 3-5

**Example**: Implementing GET /study/{slug}/start:
- BDD test: [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md#step-31-write-bdd-tests-first)
- Database model: [data-model.md](../data-model.md#interview-new)
- Implementation: [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md#step-32-implement-public-interview-router)
```

**Fix Required**: Add implementation context to contracts/README.md

---

## Strengths (Keep These)

✅ **Comprehensive research.md**: Excellent detail on pipecat integration, Firebase Auth, GCS IAM
✅ **Detailed data-model.md**: Clear schema definitions, data flows, security considerations
✅ **Complete quickstart.md**: Step-by-step phases with code examples
✅ **Thorough contracts/**: OpenAPI specs + authorization patterns
✅ **Constitution compliance**: All principles checked and satisfied

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Do First)

1. **Update plan.md Technical Context**: Replace NEEDS CLARIFICATION with references to research.md
2. **Add Implementation Roadmap to plan.md**: High-level phase overview with links to quickstart.md
3. **Add "For Developers" section to plan.md**: Clear entry point for implementation

### Medium Priority (Improve Navigation)

4. **Add cross-references in plan.md**: Link to data-model.md, contracts/, research.md where relevant
5. **Add implementation context to contracts/README.md**: Connect API specs to implementation workflow
6. **Add note to quickstart.md**: Reference plan.md for big picture

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Add dependency graph**: Visual representation of task dependencies (plan.md or quickstart.md)

---

## Verification Checklist

After fixes, verify:

- [x] Can a developer start from plan.md and find their way to quickstart.md? ✅ Added "For Developers" section
- [x] Are all NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers removed or resolved? ✅ Replaced with references to research.md
- [x] Does each phase in quickstart.md reference the relevant detailed artifact? ✅ Added note at top referencing plan.md
- [x] Can a developer find the database schema from the API endpoint docs? ✅ Added implementation workflow to contracts/README.md
- [x] Is the implementation sequence clear (infra → models → backend → frontend)? ✅ Added Implementation Roadmap with 8 phases
