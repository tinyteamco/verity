# Specification Quality Checklist: Study Management UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07 (Revised after team feedback)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Items Passed (Revised)

**Content Quality**: Spec revised to reflect team's actual needs. Designer mockups treated as inspiration, not requirements. Focus on lightweight testing approach.

**Scope Clarification**:
- ✅ Removed advanced customization features (goal reframing, tone adjustment)
- ✅ Simplified to core workflow: topic input → AI generation → basic markdown editing
- ✅ Documented what already works (16 E2E tests passing for study CRUD)
- ✅ Focused on frontend for 2 missing pieces: AI creation flow + guide editor

**Requirements**: 14 focused functional requirements (down from 17). All mapped to existing backend endpoints.

**Success Criteria**: 6 measurable criteria (down from 8). All time-based or percentage-based from user perspective.

**Acceptance Scenarios**: 4 user stories (down from 5):
1. Automated Study Creation (P1)
2. Interview Guide Editing (P1)
3. View Study with Interview Guide (P2)
4. Manual Study Creation Fallback (P3)

**Edge Cases**: 8 edge cases with clear handling strategies.

**Dependencies**: All backend endpoints verified against actual code (not assumptions).

## Notes

**Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.**

### Key Changes from Initial Version:
- Aligned with team's lightweight testing philosophy (sketches, not full mockups)
- Removed designer mockup features that aren't confirmed
- Focused on connecting existing backend to missing frontend
- Documented actual test coverage (16 E2E tests for CRUD already passing)

### What's NEW (needs implementation):
- Frontend for automated study creation (via generation endpoint)
- Frontend for interview guide editing (markdown)
- Frontend for displaying interview guides on study detail page

### Language Update:
- Removed all "AI" references per team feedback
- Focus on user value ("automated generation", "generated guide") not implementation details
- Keep spec technology-agnostic for external communication
